# Documentation

# Installation
The best way to install **adix** (other than from source) is to use pip:
```
pip install adix
```

**adix is still under development** If you encounter any data, compatibility, or installation issues, please don't hesitate to reach out!


# Quick start
The system is designed for rapid visualization of target values and dataset, facilitating quick analysis of target characteristics with just one function `ix.eda()`. Similar to pandas' df.describe() function, it provides extended analysis capabilities, accommodating time-series and text data for comprehensive insights.

```python
import adix as ix
from adix.datasets load_dataset

titanic = load_dataset('titanic')
```

## 10 minutes to **adix**


### 1. Rendering the whole dataframe
```python
ix.eda(titanic)
```
- using _forest color theme_

![whole df](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/all_var.gif)

---
### 2. Accesing variables of specific dtype
Render the DataFrame containing only categorical variables.

```python
ix.eda(titanic,vars='categorical')
```
---
### 3. Accesing individual variables
```python
ix.eda(titanic,'Age')
```
- using _forest color theme_
  
![indv var](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/one_var.gif)

---
### 4. Pandas .loc & .iloc
An easy way to render only a part of the DataFrame you are interested in.

```python
ix.eda(titanic.loc[:10:2,['Age','Pclass','Fare'])
```
---

### 5. Changing theme colors
```python
ix.Configs.get_theme()
...
ix.Configs.set_theme('FOREST')
```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/change_c.png"/></div>

---


### 6. Heatmap correlation
This visualization depicts the correlation between all numerical variables within the DataFrame, offering valuable insights into the magnitude and direction of their relationships. 


```python
# Show correlation for the entire DataFrame.
ix.eda(titanic,corr=True)

```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/corr_main.png"/></div>


Furthermore, it is possible to use categorical variables since they undergo one-hot encoding to enable their inclusion in correlation analysis. It's recommended to use ANOVA. You can choose whatever variables you want to explore and analyze.


```python
# Show correlation for selected parts of the DataFrame
ix.eda(titanic.loc[:,['Age','Fare','Sex','Survived']],vars=['categorical','continuous'],corr=True)

```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/corr_small.png"/></div>


---

### 7. Bivariate relationships:  numerical & numerical
```python
ix.eda(titanic,'Age','Fare')

```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/c_c.png"/></div>

---

### 8. Bivariate relationships:  categorical & numerical
```python
ix.eda(titanic,'Sex','Age')


```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/cat_c.png"/></div>

---

### 9. Bivariate relationships:  categorical & categorical
```python
ix.eda(titanic,'Sex','Survived')

```
<div align="center"><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imooger/adix/master/assets/cat_cat.png"/></div>

## Acknowledgement

The goal for **adix** is to make valuable information and visualization readily available in a user friendly environment at the click of a mouse, without reinventing the wheel. All of the libraries stated below are powerful and excellent alternatives to adix. Several functions of **adix** were inspired from the following:

- [Sweetviz](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz) : The inception of this project found inspiration from Sweetviz, particularly its concept of consolidating all data in one place and using the blocks for individual features.
- [Dataprep](https://github.com/sfu-db/dataprep/tree/develop) : Dataprep stands out as an excellent library for data preparation, and certain structural elements of adix have been inspired by it.
- [Pandas-Profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) : Alerts served as inspiration for a segment of the dashboard's design, contributing to its functionality and user-friendly features."
- [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) source of Titanic dataset
